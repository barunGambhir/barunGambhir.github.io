# Complete Graph Color Game

This is a two-player game designed to demonstrate the Ramsey theory concept. In this game, players take turns coloring edges of a complete graph with 6 vertices. The objective is to prove that whenever we color the edges of a complete graph of 6 vertices with two colors (blue and red), we are always able to find a monochromatic complete subgraph of 3 vertices with either blue or red.

## How to Play

1. Open the [game link](https://barungambhir.github.io/ramsey/graphGame.html).
2. Read the instructions provided on the lobby page.
3. Click on "Start Game" to begin.
4. Player 1 starts by clicking on any edge to color it blue.
5. Player 2 then clicks on any uncolored edge to color it red.
6. The game continues until one player forms a monochromatic complete subgraph of 3 vertices with either blue or red edges.
7. Once a player wins, the game stops, and a "Start New Game" button appears to begin a new game.
